This game was made on an engine made from minigin.

It utilizes programming patterns like :
-Components pattern
-Command pattern (+ InputManager)
-Observer pattern
-Singleton pattern (for managers)
-Event queue + multithreading for sound

The game is working inside one scene, to which different game objects with different components are loaded,
like in old-school consoles and arcade machines (where Q*bert belongs).
The engine is flexible enough to allow user to make other 2D-arcade-games like Pacman, Frogger, Tetris, Asteroids etc.
